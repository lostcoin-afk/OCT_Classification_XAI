contains the explanations for the test part of the OCTDL Dataset for Hybrid MobileNet ViT Pipllined and attention weighted

The explanations are only for the test part of the OCTDL dataset. The test split was created manually. I have uploaded only 30 explained images out many other disease infected images and most of them are for AMD Disease out of 5 other diseases in the OCTDL Dataset.

You can match the explanations for the different models to see that they are looking at the same pixels while making a prediciton
